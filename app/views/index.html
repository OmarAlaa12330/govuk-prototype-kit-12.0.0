      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who are we? / What is a Business Analyst?</h2>
      <p>Business Analysts understand and analyse user and business needs to provide the team with the required information inorder to deliver the solution needed.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we do?</h2>

      <p>
       As Business Analyst, our main rule is to:
       <ul>
          <li>
          <p>work with stakeholders to investigate servce, function or product provided</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>produce written documentation,  report our findings</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>support the staff and team in making recommended changes, including helping to resolve any issues</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p> Ensure plans are made and processes are created to evaluate the impact of the changes made</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>gain agreement, usually from senior management, of the best method of introducing the recommendations to the stakeholders</p>
          </li>
       </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About this page</h2>

      <p>We recommend you add links to your prototype to this page, rather than delete it.
        You'll find this page in the kit at '/app/views/index.html'.</p>

      <p>You can change the service name by editing the file '/app/config.js'.</p>
